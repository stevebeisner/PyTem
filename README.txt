PyTem Template Engine.
======================

Intro: What is PyTem?
---------------------

PyTem is an implementation of a "Python-Server-Pages"-like template
engine for Python 3+. PyTem is,

-   small -- a single python file.
-   simple -- you can learn the syntax of templates and/or the PyTem API
    in just a few minutes.
-   hackable -- readable source code, so feel free to adapt it to your
    own python project.

PyTem's current status is "Alpha", but it is being used for real work on
a daily basis.

PyTem can run as a standalone program from the command line, or can be
imported into another Python 3 program and used via a small/simple API.

Installation
------------

Install as python module:

    pip install PyTem

Syntax of PyTem Templates
-------------------------

A PyTem template is a text file (.txt, .html, .markdown, etc.)
containing, in addition the "normal" text appropriate to the file type,
python statements and python expressions.

An Example of a PyTem Template
------------------------------

Here is a file named "pytem\_demo4.tm", showing python statement lines
and lines containing pure text and python expressions.

    This is a PyTem Template it will output these two initial
    lines followed by a greeting followed by four numbered lines.
    % count = 4
    <%greeting%> to you, <% name.upper() %>. How are you?
    %    for ix in range(count):
    This is line #<% ix %>.
    %    end

The third, fifth, and seventh lines of the above template are python
statements, as indicated by the '%' at the beginning of the line.
Indentation is not significant: PyTem will correct the indentation of
the python statements during compilation of the template into pure
python. PyTem recognizes a change in required indentation by

1.  a line whose last non-whitespace character is ':', indicating the
    start of a compound statement like "`% for`", "`% if`",
    "`% else`", etc.
2.  a line like "`%  end`", indicating the close of a
    compound statement.

Anything written to Standard Output by a template's python lines will be
inserted into the template expansion.

The lines not beginning with "%" are text lines. They will be output "as
is", except that python expressions, like "`<% ix %>`" will be replaced
by the value of the enclosed python expression.

Here is a python program that will write the expanded template to
standard output,

    from pytem import PyTem
    pt = PyTem()
    s = pt.expandFile('pytem_demo4.tm', {'greeting': 'Hello',  'name': 'George'})
    print(s)

Including other templates
-------------------------

Inside a template file, another template file can be included,
interpreted in the same environment, using

        <% include_template('another.tm') %>

**NOTE:** There is nothing special about this... it's just another
python expression, calling the function, "include\_template".

PyTem API -- General Comments
-----------------------------

The API consists of three entry points: the constructor, `PyTem`, and
two methods, `expandString` and `expandFile`. Usage means calling the
constructor to obtain a PyTem instance, followed by one or more calls to
`expandString` or `expandFile`, each returning a string, and possibly
modifying the evaluation environment for future calls to `expandString`
or `expandFile` using the same PyTem instance.

Evaluation of templates involves an *environment* that provides variable
bindings for the evaluation of embedded python statements and
expressions. An initial environment may optionally be specified when the
PyTem constructor is called. Subsequent calls to `expandString` and
`expandFile` may update the environment, as may changes to variables
make by python code inside the templates.

The environment is maintained inside the PyTem instance, so changes made
during an expansion will be visible to later expansions. To start with a
clean environment, create another PyTem instance by calling the
constructor again.

Compiled template files (but not template strings) are cached, so that
they are compiled once even if used multiple time with the same PyTem
instance.

For debugging: if the pyfile option is true, then the compiled template
(i.e. pure python) named "infile" is saved in file, "infile.py", for
debugging.

PyTem API -- The Constructor
----------------------------

A instance of class, **PyTem**, is constructed and used for all
subsequent operations. A call to the constructor has the following
signature:

      pytem = PyTem( search_path = ['.'],  debug = 0,  pyfile = False, env = {})

The constructor's optional keyword arguments are:

-   `search_path` defaults to \['.'\], a list of directories in which to
    search for named templates. On the command line `search_path` is set
    with the option, "-s" or "--search\_path".

-   `debug` defaults to 0x0000, provides an optional mask of bits to
    control debug output. On the command line `debug` is set with the
    option, "-d" or "--debug".

-   `pyfile` defaults to False. If True, a file with '.py' appended to
    the name of the input template file will be created, containing the
    python code for the "compiled" input template file. On the command
    line `pyfile` is set with the option, "-p".

-   `env`, the initial evaluation environment, defaults to the empty
    dictionary, `{}`. The `env` option can not be set on the
    command line.

PyTem API -- Method `expandString`
----------------------------------

The `expandString` method optionally updates the environment with a list
of dictionaries and key/value pairs, then expands the `template_string`.
The `infilename` serves as an identifier of the string in error
messages.

        expandString(self,  template_string,  infilename(string),  *kv_dicts,  **kv_vars )

The `expandString` method return the (string) expansion of the
`template_string`.

PyTem API -- Method `expandFile`
--------------------------------

The `expandFile` method optionally updates the environment with a list
of dictionaries and key/value pairs, then expands the file named by
`infilename`. The file is searched for in the directories specified in
the `search_path` list parameter to the PyTem constructor.

        expandFile(self,   infilename,  *kv_dicts,   **kv_vars)

The `expandFile` method return the (string) expansion of the file named
by `infilename`.

PyTem API -- Method `resetEnv`
------------------------------

        resetEnv(self, new_env)

The way PyTem manages its evaluation environment is unusual, but (we
believe) useful and easy to understand.

When the PyTem instance is created, a new, empty environment is created,
and optionally populated by the optional `env` argument to the
constructor.

Each time the methods, `expandFile` or `expandString` is called the
optional `kv_dicts` and `kv_vars` arguments can update the environment.
All these environment changes are cumulative: they only update or add to
the previous environment, but don't replace it, outright. This allows a
set of expansions, and files included by `<%include_template ... %>`, to
share an environment and use it to pass information between templates.

At any point, the `resetEnv` method may be used to reset the environment
back to a specific state.

Standalone (CLI) Program
------------------------

The installed module, `pytem.py`, can be run from the command line. An
example:

        python ?wherever-its-installed?/pytem.py  -o myfile.out  myfile.tm 

You might want to create a batch file (shell script) to do this, since
`pytem.py` is probably located deep in your site-packages directory.

    Usage:  python pytem.py [options] infile, ...
    Options
      (-h | --help          This help message.
      (-d | --debug)        debug mask bits
      (-s | --search_path)  path1,path2,...
                            0x4000  Show python source
                                    for compiled templates.
                            0x0100  Minor messages
      -p                    Output the compiled template (i.e. pure python)
                            named with ".py" appended, for debugging. For infile,
                            "myfile.tm" the python file will be "myfile.tm.py".
      (-o | --out)          Out file name. Defaults to '<stdout>' if
                            not specified.
    Expands infiles in order. Keeping environment from one to the next
    If no infiles specified, or if one of the infiles is '-', use <stdin>.
